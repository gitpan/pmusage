				pmusage

This is a script for generating a perl module usage graph.
For example, to find out what modules end up getting loaded
when you use Net::FTP, run the following:

	% pmusage -format dot Net:FTP

pmusage can generate four different graph formats:

	vcg - used by the VCG tool
	dot - used by the dot tool, which is part of the graphviz toolkit
	davinci - used by daVinci
	xml - a simple xml format for storing directed graphs

The script is fully documented using pod. Once installed you should get
a man page. It also supports two informational switches:

	-help	display a short help message describing command-line options
	-doc	display the complete pod documentation for pmusage

The script requires several modules from CPAN. You can get the latest
version from www.cpan.org

    What		Where

    Graph		Jarkko's Graph class
				$CPAN/authors/id/JHI/

    Graph-ReadWrite	modules for reading+writing different graph formats
				$CPAN/authors/id/NEILB/

    AppConfig::Std	used for configuration parameters
				$CPAN/authors/id/NEILB/

    AppConfig		AppConfig::Std is a subclass of this module
				$CPAN/authors/id/ABW/


This is an early version of a work in progress -
I'd be happy to hear of any suggestions for improving this script.
